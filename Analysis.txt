The complexity of of BubbleSort and SelectionSort are both O(N^2) in a worst-case scenario analysis. The best case scenario for BubbleSort can be O(N) if we optimize it with a boolean checking if any swaps were made. The reason that SelectionSort is generally faster is that it only swaps once, whereas BubbleSort swaps many times as it iterates over the vector. However, SelectionSort cannot be optimized for a best-case scenario of O(N), which makes it slower than BubbleSort when we run algorithms that are sorted.
